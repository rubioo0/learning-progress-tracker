# ðŸš¨ TROUBLESHOOTING DEPLOYMENT ISSUES

If you're seeing "Application loading", 502, or 503 errors, follow these steps:

## 1. Check Render Logs

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to the "Logs" tab
4. Look for error messages

## 2. Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Module not found" or build errors
**Solution:** The app dependencies failed to install properly
- In Render dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "Build & Deploy"
- Manually trigger a new deploy

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution:** SQLite permissions or path issues
- This is now fixed with the updated code

### Issue: Port binding errors
**Solution:** App trying to bind to wrong port
- Render automatically sets PORT environment variable
- This is now handled correctly

## 3. If Still Not Working

### Option A: Redeploy from GitHub
1. Make sure you've pushed the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment issues"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. In Render dashboard, trigger a manual deploy

### Option B: Try Railway Instead
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway auto-deploys (usually more reliable than Render)

### Option C: Try Cyclic
1. Go to [cyclic.sh](https://cyclic.sh)
2. Connect GitHub
3. Deploy your repository

## 4. Quick Local Test

Before deploying, test locally:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Visit http://localhost:3000

If local works but deployment doesn't, it's a platform-specific issue.

## 5. Alternative: Use Free Railway

Railway tends to be more reliable than Render:

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. No configuration needed - just works!

Your app should be live in 1-2 minutes on Railway.

## Need Help?

If none of these work, the issue might be:
- Platform overloaded (try different time)
- Account limits reached
- Try a different hosting platform

**Railway is usually the most reliable free option!**
