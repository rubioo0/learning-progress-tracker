This is a test file for previewing TXT files in the Learning Progress Tracker.

The file preview feature should display this content in a formatted view with:
- Proper formatting
- Scrollable content area
- File size information
- Dark/light mode support

Testing various content types:
1. Plain text
2. Code snippets: console.log("Hello World");
3. Lists and bullet points
4. Special characters: ñáéíóú!@#$%^&*()

This demonstrates the text file preview functionality!
