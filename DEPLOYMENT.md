## Environment Variables

For production deployment, you may want to set:

- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=10000` (for Render)

## Database Persistence

The app uses SQLite which creates a local file. On free hosting:
- **Render**: Files persist between deployments
- **Railway**: Files persist
- **Cyclic**: Files may not persist (consider upgrading)

## Custom Domain (Optional)

Most platforms allow custom domains on free plans:
1. Purchase a domain from any registrar
2. Add it in your hosting platform's dashboard
3. Update DNS records as instructed

## Monitoring

Free hosting platforms provide:
- âœ… Automatic HTTPS
- âœ… Basic monitoring
- âœ… Logs and metrics
- âœ… Auto-sleep (app sleeps after 30 min of inactivity)

## Cost Considerations

**Free Tier Limitations:**
- App may sleep after inactivity (30 min)
- Limited monthly hours (usually 500-750)
- Shared resources

**To upgrade later:**
- ~$7/month for dedicated hosting
- No sleep mode
- Better performance
- More storage

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a platform** (Render recommended)
2. **Push code to GitHub**
3. **Connect and deploy**
4. **Test your live app**
5. **Share the URL with others!**
