# File Preview Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ XLSX and TXT File Preview is Already Implemented!

Your application already has full support for both XLSX and TXT file preview. Here's how to test it:

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Testing Instructions:

### 1. Open the Application
- Go to: http://localhost:3000
- Make sure you see topics loaded

### 2. Test TXT File Preview:
1. **Click on any topic** to open the modal
2. **Upload the test file**: Use `preview-test.txt` from your project root
3. **Look for the purple eye icon** (👁️) next to the attachment
4. **Click the eye icon** to preview
5. **Verify the preview modal opens** with formatted content

### 3. Test XLSX File Preview:
1. **Click on any topic** to open the modal  
2. **Upload an .xlsx file** (Excel file)
3. **Click the purple eye icon** (👁️)
4. **Verify you see**: Sheet names, data structure, A1/B1 cell content

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue 1: "No preview button appears"
**Cause**: No file attached to the topic
**Solution**: 
1. Click on a topic
2. Upload a .txt or .xlsx file first
3. The eye icon will appear after upload

### Issue 2: "Preview button doesn't work"
**Solution**: 
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for error messages
3. Look for network errors in Network tab

**Supported types**: .txt, .md, .json, .csv, .log, .xml, .html, .css, .js, .py, .java, .cpp, .c, .php, .rb, .go, .rs, .yml, .yaml, .ini, .cfg, .conf, .xlsx, .xls

### Issue 4: "File too large"

**Solution**: Use smaller test files
